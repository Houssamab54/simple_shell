# Simple Shell project 0x16.c - Jash -

âš™A simple command-line interpreter(shell) for Unix-like operating systems based on bash and Sh.

## Overview

**Jash** is a sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

### Invocation

Usage: **Jash** 
Jash is started with the standard input connected to the terminal. To start, compile all .c located in this repository by using this command: 
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o jash
./jash
```

**Jash** is allowed to be invoked interactively and non-interactively. If **jash** is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo 'alx'" | ./jash 
'alx'
$
```

When **jash** is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by isatty(3)), the interactive mode is opened. **jash** Will be using the following prompt `:) `.

Example:
```
$./jash
:)
```

If a command line argument is invoked, **jash** will take that first argument as a file from which to read commands.

Example:
```
$ cat text
echo 'alx'
$ ./jash text
'alx'
$
```
### Environment

Upon invocation, **jash** receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed. This environment is an array of *name-value* strings describing variables in the format *NAME=VALUE*. A few key environmental variables are:

#### HOME
The home directory of the current user and the default directory argument for the **cd** builtin command.

```
$ echo "echo $HOME" | ./jash
/home/vagrant
```

#### pcd
The current working directory as set by the **cd** command.

```
$ echo "echo $pcd" | ./jash
/home/vagrant/alx/simple_shell
```

#### pod
The previous working directory as set by the **cd** command.

```
$ echo "echo $pod" | ./jash
/home/vagrant/alx/project-062019-test_suite
```

#### PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands. A null directory name in the path (represented by any of two adjacent colons, an initial colon, or a trailing colon) indicates the current directory.

```
$ echo "echo $PATH" | ./jash
/home/vagrant/.cargo/bin:/home/vagrant/.local/bin:/home/vagrant/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:/home/vagrant/.rbenv/shims:/home/vagrant/.rbenv/bin:/home/vagrant/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/home/vagrant/.cargo/bin:/home/vagrant/workflow:/home/vagrant/.local/bin
```

### Command Execution

After receiving a command, **jash** tokenizes it into words using `" "` as a delimiter. The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command. **jash** then proceeds with the following actions:
1. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (`\`) nor dot (`.`), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If there exists a builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
2. If the first character of the command is none of a slash (`\`), dot (`.`), nor builtin, **jash** searches each element of the **PATH** environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
3. If the first character of the command is a slash (`\`) or dot (`.`) or either of the above searches was successful, the shell executes the named program with any remaining given arguments in a separate execution environment.

### Exit Status 

**jash** returns the exit status of the last command executed, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.
If a command is not found, the return status is 127; if a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
All the builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).

### Signals

While running in interactive mode, **jash** ignores the keyboard input ctrl+c. Alternatively, an input of End-Of-File ctrl+d will exit the program.

User hits ctrl+d in the foutrh command.
```
$ ./jash
:) ^C
:) ^C
:) ^C
:)
```

### Variable Replacement

**jash** interprets the `$` character for variable replacement.

#### $ENV_VARIABLE
`ENV_VARIABLE` is substituted with its value.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo $pcd" | ./jash
/home/vagrant/alx/simple_shell
```

#### $?
`?` is substituted with the return value of the last program executed.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo $?" | ./jash
0
```

#### $$
The second `$` is substituted with the current process ID.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo $$" | ./jash
3855
```

### Comments

**jash** ignores all words and characters preceeded by a `#` character on a line.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo 'alx' #this will be ignored!" | ./jash
'alx'
```

### Operators

**jash** specially interprets the following operator characters:

#### ; - Command separator
Commands separated by a `;` are executed sequentially.

Example:
```
$ echo "echo 'hello' ; echo 'world'" | ./jash
'hello'
'world'
```

#### && - AND logical operator
`command1 && command2`: `command2` is executed if, and only if, `command1` returns an exit status of zero.

Example:
```
$ echo "error! && echo 'alx'" | ./jash
./shellby: 1: error!: not found
$ echo "echo 'my name is' && echo 'alx'" | ./jash
'my name is'
'alx'
```

#### || - OR logical operator
`command1 || command2`: `command2` is executed if, and only if, `command1` returns a non-zero exit status.

Example:
```
$ echo "error! || echo 'wait for it'" | ./jash
./jash: 1: error!: not found
'wait for it'
```

The operators `&&` and `||` have equal precedence, followed by `;`.

### Builtin Commands

#### cd
  * Usage: `cd [DIRECTORY]`
  * Changes the current directory of the process to `DIRECTORY`.
  * If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as `cd $HOME`.
  * If the argument `-` is given, the command is interpreted as `cd $pod` and the pathname of the new working directory is printed to standad output.
  * If the argument, `--` is given, the command is interpreted as `cd $pod` but the pathname of the new working directory is not printed.
  * The environment variables `pcd` and `pod` are updated after a change of directory.

Example:
```
$ ./jash
:) pwd
/home/vagrant/alx/simple_shell
$ cd ../
:) pwd
/home/vagrant/alx
:) cd -
:) pwd
/home/vagrant/alx/simple_shell
```

#### exit
  * Usage: `exit [STATUS]`
  * Exits the shell.
  * The `STATUS` argument is the integer used to exit the shell.
  * If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as `exit 0`.

Example:
```
$ ./jash
$ exit
```

#### env
  * Usage: `env`
  * Prints the current environment.

Example:
```
$ ./jash
$ env
NVM_DIR=/home/vagrant/.nvm
...
```

#### setenv
  * Usage: `setenv [VARIABLE] [VALUE]`
  * Initializes a new environment variable, or modifies an existing one.
  * Upon failure, prints a message to `stderr`.

Example:
```
$ ./jash
$ setenv NAME ALX
$ echo $NAME
ALX
```

#### unsetenv
  * Usage: `unsetenv [VARIABLE]`
  * Removes an environmental variable.
  * Upon failure, prints a message to `stderr`.

Example:
```
$ ./jash
$ setenv NAME ALX
$ unsetenv NAME
$ echo $NAME

$
```

## More information

**Jash** is a simple shell unix command interpreter which is part of the alx low level programming module at ALX and is intended to emulate the basics **sh** shell. All the information given in this README is based on the **jash** and **bash** man (1) pages.
